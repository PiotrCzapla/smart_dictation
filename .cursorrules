# Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
- Use Python 3.11 syntax.
- Libraries: anyio (async with asyncio.run), typer (CLI), Pydantic V2 (use model_* methods, e.g., model_dump_json), pathlib (file ops), pandas (math), diskcache (caching)
- Features: match statements, dataclasses, f-strings, context managers, Enums, functools (lru_cache, partial)
- Typing: list | None (not List/Optional), type narrowing (assert isinstance)
- Principles: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
